# Partial application

> Lesson **13** / 35 · path `functions/partial_application`

**Partial application**: A function returning another function that might return another function, but each returned function can take several parameters.

Let's have a look into `functions` and how they are defined and called:

* solve each question: `ex00, ex01, ...` by only modifying X with a 
`value` of type `Int`

**Note:** If you see `ex03 = <LAMBDA>;` after `run`, this means 
that `ex03` is bound to a `function`.

## Starting code

```nix
let
  b = 1;
  fu0 = (x: x);
  fu1 = (x: y: x + y) 4;
  fu2 = (x: y: (2 * x) + y);
in
rec {
  ex00 = fu0 X;     # must return 4
#  ex01 = (fu1) X;   # must return 5
#  ex02 = (fu2 X ) X; # must return 7
#  ex03 = (fu2 X );   # must return <LAMBDA>s
#  ex04 = ex03 X;    # must return 7
#  ex05 = (n: x: (fu2 x n)) X X; # must return 7
}
```

## Solution

```nix
let
  b = 1;
  fu0 = (x: x);
  fu1 = (x: y: x + y) 4;
  fu2 = (x: y: (2 * x) + y);
in
rec {
  ex00 = fu0 4;     # must return 4
  ex01 = (fu1) 1;   # must return 5
  ex02 = (fu2 2) 3; # must return 7
  ex03 = (fu2 3);   # must return <LAMBDA>
  ex04 = ex03 1;    # must return 7
  ex05 = (n: x: (fu2 x n)) 3 2; # must return 7
}
```
